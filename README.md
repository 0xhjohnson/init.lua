## 0x's init.lua

### Prerequisite

- install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) so [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) works properly
- ensure that font supports icons (dank mono patched using [nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) is my choice)
- install node ([fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) is what i use)
- ensure [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim#requirements) requirements are met

This config is tailored to fit my needs and probs isn't for everyone. Starts in 40ms if you are a nerd that cares about stuff like that.
